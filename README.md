# CAOS_project
This project was developed during the Computer Architectures and Operation Systems of the Master's degree in Cybersecurity at Politecnico di Torino.

The target board is the NXP S32K3X8EVB, that is bases on a the 32-bit ArmÂ®CortexÂ®-M7 S32K358 MCU. According to the documentation, arm cortex-m7 it's based on a armv7-m architecture. This means that we can use the already implemented cpu defined in the file `hw/arm/armv7m.c` (so no need of following the second and following chapters of the [Florian GÃ¶hler's guide](https://fgoehler.com/blog/adding-a-new-architecture-to-qemu-01/).

In the source folder there is the file we started to work on Monday + vexpress (the one the "Adding a custom ARM platform to Qemu" link talks about); The #include are commented.

## Preparing the environment
First of all, you need to install git and some other dependencies. For the list of the necessary dependencies look at the [official Qemu doumentation](https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/Linux). Then we get the code from the Qemu's GitHub repository and check if the build configuration works correctly:
```
    git clone https://github.com/qemu/qemu.git
    cd qemu
    ./configure
```
If the configuration succeeds, then you can go to the next step.
Then checkout to a stable branch:
```
git checkout stable-9.1
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```
## Adding the board NXP S32K3X8EVB
To add an unsupported board in Qemu we need to create the corresponding file in Qemu/hw.
The S32K3X8EVB-Q289 board is based on the 32-bit ArmÂ®CortexÂ®-M7 S32K3 MCU. So let's have a look to a similar board already implemented. In particular the board ARM V2M MPS2 is similarly based on arm-cortex-m7. Its file can be found at Qemu/hw/mps2.c.

## Recompile Qemu
After having added the support for the new board, we need to recompile Qemu:
```
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --target-list=our-arch
make
```
